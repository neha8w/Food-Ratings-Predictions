# Food-Ratings-Predictions
->Predict food ratings based on recipe ingredients and descriptions.
Developed a predictive model to estimate food ratings based on recipe ingredients and instructions using machine learning techniques, primarily focusing on Random Forest Regressor and exploring alternatives like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.
Implemented comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering, including TF-IDF vectorization for textual data, alongside exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights into the dataset.
Achieved a target accuracy of 0.75 through model tuning and evaluation, enabling data-driven recommendations for food-related applications.
